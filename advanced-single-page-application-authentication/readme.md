## Securing Spring APIs with JSON Web Tokens
Spring is a powerful stack for building Java based APIs. Spring Security gives us a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access control framework for our APIs. But this is a Java User Group so you probably already knew that. If not, we’ll go over the basics of setting up and securing a Spring based API.

Next, we’ll build a Single Page Application with VueJS and show how it can securely consume our Spring API. We’ll cover authentication, authorization, how to use JSON Web Tokens and identity best practices to ensure your next application is as secure as it can be.
