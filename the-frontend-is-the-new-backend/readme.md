## The Frontend is the New Backend
In the last couple of years, we have seen a significant shift in the way we write apps. More and more, logic is being pushed to the client (browser, native apps, IoT) and new services have emerged to reduce even more the need of backends. But there's more to come. What if we don't need ANY server at all? What if we could write apps mixing client and server side code without having to worry how that code runs? 

 In this session we will go over a new way of writing completely backendless applications using Webtask.
